## Data Types and Control Flow in Dart

This Dart program demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including data types, type conversions, control flow statements (if-else, switch-case), and loops. It combines these concepts to provide a solid foundation for beginners learning Dart.

## Features

Data Types: Defines and initializes variables of types int, double, String, bool, and List.

Type Conversion: Functions to convert between String, int, and double.

Control Flow:

if-else statements to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

Voting eligibility check based on age.

switch statement to print the day of the week based on an integer.

Loops:

for loop printing numbers 1 to 10.

while loop printing numbers 10 to 1.

do-while loop printing numbers 1 to 5.

Combined Example: Iterates over a list of integers, prints each number, checks if itâ€™s even or odd, and categorizes it as small, medium, or large using a switch statement.

## How to Run

Ensure you have Dart SDK installed. If not, download it from dart.dev.

Save the program file as data_types_and_control_flow.dart.

Run the program using the command:
dart run data_types_and_control_flow.dart

## Code Overview
